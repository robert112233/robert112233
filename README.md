### Greetings 👋

I'm a traversee of multiple Northcoders bootcamps; mentoring and educating students on Software Engineering, Data Engineering and Cloud Engineering 😎 I have been coding for over two years and I love to learn and explore new programming concepts, with a particular interest in algorithms and dynamic programming.
